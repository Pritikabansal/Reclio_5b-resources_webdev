            <div class="heading_content">Web development is a skill that involves creating and maintaining websites for
                various purposes. Web development can be divided into front-end development, which deals with the user
                interface and interactivity of a website, and back-end development, which handles the data processing
                and business logic of a website. Web development can also involve using various tools, frameworks,
                libraries, and languages to enhance the functionality and performance of a website. <br><br>
                If you want to learn web development, there are many online resources that can help you. <br>
                These resources for web development that I mentioned is to help you learn the skills and concepts that
                are required for creating and maintaining websites. Each resource has its own advantages and
                disadvantages, and you can use them according to your learning style, goals, and preferences.
